# Coarse_Wood_Decay_Model_Carbon_Nitrogen

This repository contains a process-based model written in Python to simulate carbon and nitrogen dynamics during the decay of coarse woody material (snags and downed wood) at the cohort and ecosystem scales. The model supports analyses of forest biogeochemical cycles and is used in a peer-reviewed manuscript currently in review.
